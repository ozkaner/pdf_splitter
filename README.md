## Overview

This Python script splits a PDF file into individual pages and saves each page as a separate PDF file. It utilizes the PyPDF2 library to achieve this functionality.

### Requirements

PyPDF2 library (pip install PyPDF2)
pycryptodome (pip install pycryptodome)

```bash
pip install PyPDF2 pycryptodome

```

### Usage 
Place your PDF file (input.pdf) in the same directory as the script.
